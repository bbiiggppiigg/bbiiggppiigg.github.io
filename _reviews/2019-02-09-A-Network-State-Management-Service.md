## Problem 

Resolving conflicts between updates of network states in a distributed manner. The conflicting applications may or may not be in the same network layer.
For example, configuration update and firmware update ( which cause the switch to be irresponsive ) conflict with each other though one of them operates
at the forwarding behavior level and one operates at the OS level.  

## Solution

The authors abstracts the network states as multiple variable value pairs. 
To capture the problem of conflicting state assignment between variables of differetn layer, each variable is associated with a "controllability bit",
which can be used to build a dependency graph. A variable is controllable only if all its dependencies are controllable.

Network Updates in Stateman primarily works around three kinds of state:
1. Observed state (OS) the view of current state of the network.
2. Proposed state (PS) are update proposal generated by each component after reading OS as input.
3. Target state (TS) is the combination of compatible PSs that might be applied to OS.
